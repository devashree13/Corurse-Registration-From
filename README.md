This project is a simple course registration system that demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using:

JavaScript for the frontend (form validation and user interaction)

Spring Boot for building RESTful APIs and handling backend logic

MySQL for storing user registration data

Users can fill out a form with their details and course preferences. The data is validated on the frontend and then submitted to the backend API, which stores it in a MySQL database.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the integration between frontend, backend, and database in a real-world application.
